# Minimal system requirements for pip-only redundancy testing
# Only includes C libraries that CANNOT be satisfied by pip

# anisible-pylibssh REQUIRES libssh C library
# This is the only truly mandatory system dependency
libssh [platform:rpm]
libssh-devel [compile platform:rpm]

# Build essentials (gcc already added in prepend_base)
# These are needed for pip to compile wheels

# NOTE: All python3-* packages are intentionally OMITTED
# to test if pip-only installation works
